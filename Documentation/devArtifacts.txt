Our development artifacts, including our product backlog and meeting log, for this project can be found on our
Trello board for the project (Link:"https://trello.com/b/wAVYijOL/project-2"). Trello organizes "boards" (the level
of the entire project), into lists of cards. For our project, this includes the lists titled "Product Backlog", "Team Meeting Log",
as well as others for our own use ("To Do", "Doing", "Done"). Any of the cards within the lists can be interacted with simply by
clicking. On each of the cards in the product backlog, we have a color tag indicating the status of the feature and a description
that can be viewed by clicking on the card. Similarly, for our team meeting log, we have given the cards titles specifying the Date
and time of the meeting with additional details and information in the description of the card.
